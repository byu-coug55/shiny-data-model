## Intro
I created my [Marathon Data App](https://byu-coug55.shinyapps.io/Marathon_Data_App/) to help me compare my marathon results with other athlete's results. My time wasn't very good, but interestingly my power output was similar to other runners. In analyzing the data, you could also see that power output was negatively correlated with marathon time - i.e. as you increase power output, you go faster!

This led me to the thought of creating a Shiny web app that would allow a user to import a dataset and analyze the correlation between any two variables.

This web app took a while to develop as there were several things that could go wrong, but I think I worked out all the kinks. If you find that any improvements are needed, please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lance-christian-byu/).
